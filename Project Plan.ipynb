Pokemon, Dragonball, etc. are examples of Anime. \n","*   The goal of this project is to create a Anime recommendation algorithm and to recommend Anime according to the user's taste\n","*   Once it is tuned to be as accurate as possible, it can provide value by recommending users which amime to watch and provide insights to companies what features are popular for anime.  \n","* Iâ€™ll implement an unsupervised machine learning model such as kmeans or others that can provide segementation on Anime viewers and providing the  number of clusters. Then try variety of supervised classification models to recommend an Anime to an user. This will be done through pyspark for big data.\n","* The biggest challenge will be tuning for accuracy. The acceptable accuracy for businesses for models are usually around 80%.
